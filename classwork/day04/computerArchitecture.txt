Q: 	how fast does electricity move?
A: 	electricity is energy through the medium of electrons
	somewhere between 0.5 C (light speed) and 0.9 C 

Q: 	how far does light travel in 1ns
A: 	30cm = 1ft

Q:	how to avoid the latency (delay in getting data to and from RAM) of a roundtrip?
A:	Mulitple Solutions
	1.	Ask in advance (pipelining)
	2. 	Ask for mulitple things at once (vectorization)
	3. 	Caching (keep data you want close)

Q:	To addresss n units of memory how many bits do I need in the
	address bus
A: 256 				--> 8  bits
A: 65536 			--> 16 bits
A: 4.2 billion		--> 32 bits
A: 16 quadrillion	--> 64 bits

Q: How big do numbers get when you mulitply them
   (8) 
	99
x	99
--------
   891
  8910
--------
  9801

 101011000
x101110001

64 bits x 64 bits  = 128 bits

most 64 bit computers will just give you a 64 bit answer

Q:	What is an n-bit computer?
A:	Generally, ALU is n-bits wide, and often so is the data bus

Special case: if we know we don't want much memory, the address bus can be smaller

Note: 	DDR4 DDR5 gives burst of 8 values
		please give me location 512
		30 clock cycles later... memory returns 
		512...519 (gives 8 bytes when you ask for 1)
		520...527 + 1
		528...536 + 1
		...
		... + 7
