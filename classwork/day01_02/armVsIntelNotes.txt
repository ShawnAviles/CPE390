ARM

	add r3, r1, r2 // r3 = r1 + r2
	div r4, r1, r2

INTEL

	mov r1, r3
	add r2 r3

imul -> signed integer multiplication
umul -> unsigned integer multiplication

only allows for dividing among two registers
idiv -> divide this specfic register

Extra:
you could write assembly code as a job, mainly for companies where they care more about speed like nnvidia for GPUs
