Part 1:
Find out the following information and record: 
	The model of the CPU on your laptop: 		Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U
	The clock speed of your laptop:				2.70 GHz
	The kind of memory on your laptop:			DDR3
	The amount of RAM in your laptop:			8.00 GB 
	The speed of the RAM in your laptop:		1867 MHz
	The amount of cache for your laptop:		128 KB

Part 3:
How much faster is CRC using intrinsics vs. regular C++?


Why is the CRC using the intrinsics more efficient than the crc code written in straight C++?
	
What is an Intel Intrinsic?

What is the disadvantage of embedding an intrinsic in your code?

We did not have time to benchmark the dov vs. the dov8 code. But the dov8 is optimized by precomputing the key into 64-bit values. Estimate how much more efficient the dov8 code might be on processing a large (1GB) block of memory.
